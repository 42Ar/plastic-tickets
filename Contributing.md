# Contributing

Thank you for digging into this project!    
There are some small things to read, before you can start coding.

## Style guidelines

Python code has to follow the
 [PEP 8 style guide](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008).

A python linter/formatter should cover all of the relevant rules.   
Just limit all lines to a maximum of 79 characters and you should be good to go.

**All** other source files also have to be limited to 79 characters per line.
There maybe some exceptions, but be prepared to defend these in discussions!

## Pull requests

### Commits

Commits should follow the **recipe based system**. Commits are viewed as small,
self-contained changes (recipes). Between two commits the project should be in a
useful, well defined state. For example, if you add code in one commit and
modify it in another following one, you probably should join these changes into
one. In a pull request every commit will be viewed individually - if it is not
useful as a individual one, you should join it with others. These commits should
not serve as your personal log, but rather summarize your work in a useful way.

Here is also some further info about the recipe based system:

### Commit messages

All interesting info about changes should be contained in the commit messages.
Look at the output of `git log` if you are unsure about the style of commit
messages.

If you are completely new, here is a nice and well known blog post about commit
messages: https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/

## Branches

Please base your work on the `main` branch. Expect other branches as work in
progress.

## Miscellaneous

Please use a **spell checker**!

Be nice to other people :)
